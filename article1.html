								<p>In the early days of web design, pages were built to target a particular screen size. If the user had a 
larger or smaller screen than the designer expected, results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to overly long line lengths, and poor use of space. 
Responsive Web Design is
a graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used to create content that adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes, making a website look good on all devices  
using HTML and CSS to automatically resize a website.  
<br><br>As more diverse screen sizes became available, the concept of responsive design was developed, a set of practices that allows web pages to 
alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a
multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.
The use of mobile devices to surf the web continues to grow at an astronomical pace, and these devices are often constrained by 
display size and require a different approach to how content is laid out on the screen. 
A multitude of different screen sizes exist across phones, tablets, desktops, game consoles, TVs, and even wearables. Screen sizes are 
always changing, so it's important that your site can adapt to any screen size, today or in the future. In addition, 
devices have different features with which we interact with them. For example some of your visitors will be using a 
touchscreen. Modern responsive design considers all of these things to optimize the experience for everyone.
